## What is the Water_Sort_Game?
The water sort game consists of a number of bottles (one plus the number of colors in the game to be precise) where after you the user give the
game the colors that you want to play with and the capacity of your bottles and then the game randomly distributes the colors among the bottles in a way that
no color appears more than the capacity that we set for the game (each color appears exactly as many times as the capacity).

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
